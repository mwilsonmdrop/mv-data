		"Fire damage mitigation is a two-step process. First, we start by drying everything out and removing any water damage. Fires cause water damage in a number of ways: water from firefighters, damaged pipes and possible rain or snow while the fire happens. We dry out any water residue/humidity and remove anything that is damaged. The second step is clearing the smoke damage. Soot residue needs to be removed immediately. We reach the smallest areas of the home to clear smoke damage and deodorize your property. Then, we can begin rebuilding."

		"Water damage mitigation starts by stopping water from spreading to other areas. After that, we remove any water and dry out the property. That also includes removing moisture from the air with dehumidifiers. Electrical, flooring and drywall may need to be removed to prevent the spread of mold. After all the water-damaged materials are dried or removed, we can start the process of restoring your property.",
		"After a storm, we remove any debris and damaged items. One of the biggest concerns with storm damage mitigation is water. We must remove anything the water touched to prevent further damage and ensure a safe environment. After all the damage is removed, then we can begin restoration.",
		"Mold damage remediation is a multi-step process. The initial step is identifying the source of the mold and applying an antimicrobial to stop its spread. Containment is key. We then scrub the air by creating evaporation and drying it out. This ensures that mold spores and other airborne debris are removed. The only way to properly repair the damage it to remove any mold-touch areas. That could include removing carpet, wood trim, drywall, insulation and even furniture. After all the mold is removed, we will replace and repair all the affected areas.",
